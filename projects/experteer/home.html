                <p>The old Experteer application is far from perfect when it comes to UX. I was the only UX designer in
                    the team. I was challenged to design a fresh and appealing user experience from scratch so the new
                    app could retain its target audience and attract new candidates. At the same time, I was challenged
                    to communicate with Skateholders, product managers and developers by my own and fight for the best
                    design solutions. </p>

                <p><b>ROLE</b></p>

                <p>As the only designer in the team, I was responsible for the user experience design from “0” to “1”.
                    I defined key features with product manager and skateholder, lauched the product with develop team
                    and continue iterate according to feedbacks. I conducted brainstorm sessions, created user flow,
                    wireframe, communicated with skateholder and team members, conducted several design review
                    meetings, worked on visual design, created brand language and maintained design styleguide. I also
                    helped product manager to supervise and test the implementation to make sure the final product can
                    meet the requirements and deadline, continue iterating.</p>

            <h5>Research & Ideas
            </h5>

            <p>First it took me sometime to understood the business model of Experteer and the vision of new mobile
                experience. Experteer has a unique market position as the premium career and recruitment service.
                The question began with how to highlight our strengths and different us from competitors. Having
                understood the business model, I focused on researching recruitment trends and recent innovations.
                To do so, I carefully examine the apps of the most popular vendors in the sphere – Linkedin,
                Monster, Glassdoor, Indeed, and others. This research gave me a couple of useful insights and
                valuable ideas. </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Information architecture</h5>

            <p>After research and rounds of discussion with skateholder, product managers, CRM team and developeps,
                we defined key features of our product and start the UX stage with creating the basic information
                architecture.</p>

        <h5>Flow diagram</h5>
        <p>Next step was created flow diagram, which helps us to figure out how people interact with our product. Flow
            diagram define possible routes in the user journey through the product. </p>

        <h5>Wireframing, validation and iteration</h5>
        <p>
            After flow diagram have been proved, I created wireframes (starting from drawing the first sketches on
            paper ended up with high-fidelity mockups). </p>

            Career path prediction is an unique and important feature of the product. The graph is to visualize the
            user different options how to advance in his career. </p>
            <p>	• 	For basic users, the goal is to convert them into paying members
                <br>    • 	per default the first node in the first graph is selected
                <br>    • 	there are two places where the graph can be shown: Job detail page and Dashboard 
                <br>    • 	Basic users don‘t see the full graph, the upper part of the graph is hidden and links to the upsell page
                <br>    • 	Premium users can interact with the whole graph</p>
